    <p>Although existing identifiers may display some of these characteristics, none currently displays all four.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="sotd"></section>
    <section id="intro">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The need for globally unique identifier schemes has been addressed many 
      times. Globally unique ID schemes typically rely on a central authority 
      controlling a 'root' space that is then delegated to local organizations 
      who in turn delegate to further organizations who eventually add the final 
      string to complete the identifier. Even if we restrict ourselves to online 
      identifiers, there are many examples of this.</p><ul>
  <li>IANA controls the root namespace of the Internet's Domain Name System;
      registrars operate the top level domains and then license specific domain
      names to their clients, and it's these clients who create the actual
      identifiers for online resources (URLs). The example below shows who
      controls what in a typical URL.

<pre class="example">

                IANA
                 ↓
https://example.com/page.html
           ↑           ↑
        Registrar   Licensee
</pre></li>
  <li><abbr title="Digital Object Identifier">DOI</abbr>s have the form
    <code>10.{registrant}/{suffix}</code> where 'registrant' is defined by the
    DOI organization and the suffix by the registrant.</li>
  <li>Global Trade Item Numbers (GTINs) seen on many of the world's barcodes
      are managed in a similar way, as are Legal Entity Identifiers,
      <abbr title="International Standard Book Number">ISBN</abbr>s and more.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In all these cases, ultimately, there is a central authority on which the
   identifier system depends. Those central authorities go to significant
    efforts to make their identifiers persistent and resolvable, however,
    should they cease to exist, the long term integrity of the identifier
    is at least questionable to a greater or lesser extent. For as long as
    those organizations exist (and they are generally well established with no
    immediate threat to their survival), the way to assess whether a particular
    identifier is in some way 'valid' is to query the issuing authority.</p>
  <p>These factors point to a need in some circumstances for a globally unique
    identifier that is 'self sovereign', that is, one that does not depend on
    any issuing authority. Universally unique identifiers (<a>UUID</a>s) [[RFC4122]]
    fulfill this role, however, there is no way to <em>prove</em> control of
    a <abbr title="Universally unique identifier">UUID</abbr>.</p>
  <p>This document sets out use cases and requirements for a new kind of
    identifier that meets all these basic requirements:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>decentralized</strong>: there should be no central issuing
        agency;</li>
        <li><strong>persistent</strong>: the identifier should be inherently
        persistent, not requiring the continued operation of an underling organization;</li>
        <li><strong>cryptographically verifiable</strong>: it should be possible 
        to prove control of the identifier cryptographically;</li>
        <li><strong>resolvable</strong>: it should be possible to discover
        metadata about the identifier.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Existing Work</h3>
    <p>The use cases and requirements set out below have not been created <i>a
        priori</i>. Substantial work has been done within W3C and elsewhere
        leading, in particular, to <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/08/did-20190828/">Decentralized
        Identifiers (DIDs) Data Model and Syntaxes</a> published as a Community
        Group Report by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">Credentials
        Community Group</a> in August 2019. That work provides a framework &mdash;
        a set of concepts &mdash; that have proved to be useful when discussing
        <abbr title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>s and the problems they
        can solve (see below). Those concepts are used within this document to
        set out the detail of the problem that the Decentralized Identifier Working
        Group is <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/09/did-wg-charter">chartered</a>
        to solve. It is the nature of the standardization process that these
        terms may be modified within the standard itself and therefore, their
        use here should not be seen as authoritative.</p>
      </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id="concepts">Concepts of Decentralized Identity</h2>
	<p class="issue" data-number="39">Terminology in this opening prose is being discussed, in particular
	the term 'relying party' which has been changed to 'requesting party' in this version of the doc.</p>
        <p>A decentralized system will enable several key actions by three
		distinct entities: the Controller, the Requesting Party, and the Subject.</p>
        <p>Controllers create and control <abbr title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>s,
		while Requesting Parties rely on <abbr title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>s
          as an identifier for  interactions related to the <a>DID Subject</a>.</p>
        <p>The Subject is the entity referred to by the <abbr title="Decentralized
          Identifier">DID</abbr>, which can be anything: a person,  an organization,
          a device, a location, even a concept. Typically, the Subject is also
          the Controller, but in cases of guardianship, agents (human or software),
          and inanimate Subjects, this is not possible. As such, the Subject has
		no functional  role. When the Subject is, in fact, the <a>DID Controller</a>, we
          consider the action to  be taken by the Controller on their own behalf
          as the Subject. When the Subject  is not the DID Controller, the Controller
          is said to be taking action on behalf of the Subject, such as when an
          employee manages a <abbr title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>
          on behalf of their employer  or a parent uses a <abbr title="Decentralized
          Identifier">DID</abbr> on behalf of their child.</p>
	    <p>The DID Controller and Requesting Party may be individuals or interactive
          systems, but for simplicity in this document, we refer to both as if
          they were individual  persons performing these actions. </p>
	  <p>Only a <a>DID Controller</a> can perform the actions that control a <abbr
          title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>, however, anyone can act
	  as a Requesting Party for any <abbr title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>
          they know, including the DID Controller, should they wish to inspect or
          verify their own <abbr title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>.</p>
        <p>This use case document defines these actions in terms of the eventual
          systems we anticipate using the resultant specification.</p>

        <p>Perhaps the most salient point about <a>Decentralized Identifiers</a> is
        that there are no "Identity Providers". Instead, this role is subsumed
        in the decentralized systems that Controllers use to manage <abbr
        title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>s and, in turn, Requesting
		Parties use to apply <abbr title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>s.
        These  decentralized systems, which we refer to as <abbr
        title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr> registries, are designed to
        operate independently from any particular service provider and hence,
        free from  any given platform authority. It is anticipated that <abbr
        title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>s will be registered using
        distributed ledger technology (<a>DLT</a>).

        <p>In practice, the definition and operation of all current decentralized
        systems retain some elements of centralized control. Depending on the
        criteria one uses to evaluate such systems &mdash; from who controls
        the most widely used code base to who controls  the specification &mdash;
        where a system resides on the spectrum of centralized and decentralized
        varies. However, the design of any decentralized identity system is
        separate from the  academic debate about how decentralized it may be
        in practice.</p>
        <p>The use cases presented below make use of a number of high level
        concepts as follows.</p>

<div class="note" title="Shared terminology">
  <p>This section is automatically synchronised with the terminology section in
    the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">DID Core</a> specification.</p></div>

  <div data-include="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/terms.html"
      data-oninclude="restrictReferences">
  </div>

  <p class="issue" data-number="14">The term DID registry is under discussion within the Working Group.
  A particular point to bear in mind is that not all DID methods require DIDs to be registered to be functional.</p>

<p>When we refer to <em>methods</em> and <em>registries</em>, we mean <a><abbr
  title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr> methods</a> and <a><abbr title="Decentralized
  Identifier">DID</abbr> registries</a>. A working assumption for the use cases is that all
  <abbr title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>s resolve to <abbr title="Decentralized
  Identifier">DID</abbr> Documents. <abbr title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>
  Documents contain the cryptographic material to perform the functions related to
  that particular <abbr title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>, including
  associated proof methods and any service endpoints, that is, services that can
  make use of the <abbr title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>.</p>

        <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <section id="onlineShopper">
          <h3>Online shopper</h3>
        <p>Traditionally, a shopper frequents a trusted retailer and can physically hold the products they wish to purchase.
		The product and the information about it is trusted because it is put there by the brand, and the shopper trusts that
		the retailer has received the product through trusted supply chain partners. Today, there is a multitude of
		channels and platforms for selling and buying products. The internet has changed consumer purchasing behavior
		as more and more commerce is conducted digitally. This introduces new challenges for brands, retailers and consumers,
		as the relationship is not as direct as the traditional mode of shopping.</p>
        <p>Online shopping, especially through 3rd party marketplaces, creates a proliferation of digital records about that product
		across platforms. Unlike a physical product, a consumer cannot be assured that the record (and the information
		presented about that product) came from the brand or other authoritative source. Product identification and information
		and the source of the product itself is less reliable, and introduces trust issues with representations of products
		bought and sold online. Additionally, unique identification is critical to business processes, but also to online
		purchasing. Very often two different products share the same identifier across the supply chain, and so what a
		consumer purchases and what ultimately is received may be different.</p>
        <p>Mechanisms are required for the following to provide trust in the digital representation of a product across platforms:</p>
	<ol>
          <li>validation of the legitimacy of an online listing &mdash; in particular on third party marketplaces;</li>
          <li>assurance of identification uniqueness and key identifying data element accuracy.</li>

		<p>When Bertha bought her new car, it came with its own DID, not just as an alternative 
			<abbr title="Vehicle Identification Number">VIN</abbr>, but with unique DIDs for every replaceable 
			component in the vehicle and a secure data storage for keeping track of vehicle use and maintenance. 
			Even before she purchased it, she was able to verify that, as advertised, every part in the car is 
			100% made with carbon-neutral processes as certified by various independent agencies.</p>
		<p>As the controller of the car's DID, she had automatic control over all of its components' DIDs. During 
			maintenance, she would choose mechanics that automatically provided digital records of their work, 
			stored at her direction in the car's data store. When a part needed to be replaced, she'd make sure 
			the new component's DID is recorded and the old one retired. Similarly, her car automatically tracked 
			fuel purchases and saved telemetry reports to storage, where it was kept securely under her control.</p>
		<p>She found an insurance company that was able to automatically offer her a discount after passing a certification 
			of good maintenance and good driving. When she later put her car up for sale, she was able to prove her 
			track record of maintenance. Upon sale, she transferred control over the car's DID and its secure storage, 
			giving the new owner a working, and contiguous record of the vehicle.</p>
		
<!--		
	<p>Manufactured goods are usually the output of multiple processes carried out by multiple actors. Think of a vehicle
	(be it a ship, a train, a car or a plane) with
	components and assemblies of components from multiple suppliers that are then added to the emerging vehicle as it makes its
	way along the production line. During the lifetime of that vehicle, components will be replaced and serviced, and this work
	can be carried out by any number of different agents.</p>
	<p>A mechanism that allows each agent to make independent assertions about their work – the components created or replaced,
	the tests carried out, which part was married up to which other part and so on – would allow the complete manufacturing and
	service history of the vehicle to be computed.</p>
	<p>The independent aspect is important. A decentralized identifier created and applied to each component or assembly can be
	cryptographically verified without the need to call home to a supply company that may or may not continue to exist. Moreover, there
	is no requirement for the overall vehicle manufacturer to maintain an aggregated database  concerning a vehicle that, in a
	traditional system, is not only a single point of failure but that is immediately out of date as soon as the vehicle goes in
	for its first service. A decentralized system allows each component of the vehicle to have its own history, its own credentials
	and its own lifecycle, independent of other components and the vehicle – or vehicles – of which it is a part over time. At the end of its life,
	the identifier may continue to be useful as a reference point for recycling and safe disposal information, even if the original
	manufacturer is no longer in business.</p>
	<p>The vehicle itself has its own identifier too. This would allow that particular vehicle to be a reference for the components
	and any licensing, insurance, servicing etc. Again, the decentralized nature of DIDs promises <em>subsequent owners</em> control
	over the identifier without dependency on any central agency allowing the maintenance record(s) to transition smoothly throughout
	the entire lifecycle of the vehicle.</p>-->

	<section id="edv"><h3>Encrypted Data Vault</h3>
	<p>Data stored in the cloud is typically visible to the cloud platform operator, even when flagged as being ‘only accessible to
	you.’ For data to be stored in the cloud – in other words, on someone else’s computer – and for it to be only accessible to the data
	owner, it must be encrypted. A Decentralized Identifier that leads to information with which a user can prove control of the
	identifier without resort to a centralized authority could enable substitutable encrypted cloud storage. That is, the data owner
	would be able to change cloud storage provider, take their encrypted data with them, and still offer fine-grained access control
	to specific parties or their delegates. Associating cryptographic information with the DID would allow the data owner to change
	their keys and <em>still</em> be able to control access without having to decrypt and re-encrypt it.</p>

	<section id="accessingServiceEndpoints"><h3>Accessing Master Data of Entities</h3>
	<p>Decentralized identifiers allow one to discover the location of an authoritative public master data record of an entity.
	This mechanism can be used for organizations as well as things. The authoritative master data record could be retrieved from a
	designated service endpoint listed in the DID document. The record may be self-certifying, i.e. verifiable with a key listed in the
	DID document or third party attested represented as a <a
	href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifiable-presentations">verifiable presentation</a>.</p>
	<p>The third party attesting master data of an organization might be a chamber of commerce, while the third party attesting
	the master data of a thing might be its manufacturer. The decentralized nature of the identifier is important in particular
	for the device as the DID can act as an entry to that master data even if the manufacturer goes out of business or stops the
	service.</p>

	<section id="vcEcosystem"><h3>Identifiers in an ecosystem of verifiable credentials (VCs)</h3>
	<p>Remembering the <a href="#abstract">4 essential characteristics of a decentralized identifier</a>, there are situations
		where DIDs offer tangible benefits over existing identifier schemes. For example:</p><ul>
	<li>Verifiable credential issuers publishing the list of subject attributes that they are authoritative for (their
		authoritative nature can be proven).</li>
	<li>In similar vein, Verifiable Credential issuers may publish authoritative schemas for the types of credential that they issue.</li>
	<li>Terms of use or other policy constraints that might apply to issued <abbr title="Verifiable Credential">VC</abbr>s.</li>
	<li>A published list of the public keys used to sign credentials becomes useful in a chain of trust if that list can itself
		be verified.</li>
	<li>The controller of a decentralized identifier can rotate (update) their cryptographic keys, either to overcome their existing keys 
		being compromised or the development of superior technology. This does not affect the validity or provability of any 
		verifiable credentials associated with that identifier.</li>

          <h3>Sharing opted-in information across platforms</h3>
	<p>Individuals are concerned that their online activity is tracked and analysed by many websites and third party services
	without their full knowledge. Consent for the storing of cookies is routinely given without any real care being taken,
	and service terms and conditions rarely read before being agreed to. A solution to this problem might have the following
	characteristics:</p><ol>
	<li>The ability to create an identifier for oneself without having to provide any personally identifiable information (PII)
		to any third party.</li>
	<li>The ability to prove control of that identifier, again, without revealing any PII.</li>
	<li>The ability to associate information likely to be of commercial interest with that identifier, such as purchase history,
		age, gender or social status, again, without revealing any PII.</li>
		</ol>
	<p>Such an identifier could be shared across multiple platforms that would be able to use it to provide a more customized 
	service, but without gaining any PII and therefore without being able to correlate with other services that did depend the 
	individual’s identity, such as their health records. A single individual would be well able to maintain multiple online 
	personas in this way and thereby have good control over what they did and didn't share with different services.</p>

  <section id="supplyChain"><h3>Anonymity within a supply chain</h3>
	<p>Modern supply chains are highly complex, typically involving multiple companies taking ownership and/or custody of shipments from the point of
	origin through to the final destination, be that a retailer or end consumer. Furthermore, since most mass-produced products are made to stock rather than 
	bespoke for a specific customer, the manufacturer typically does not know which final  retailer or retail store will receive each specific product instance; 
	the individual path through the supply chain network is not predefined by the manufacturer but instead emerges over time as a set of intermediate distributors 
	and wholesalers distribute product in response to orders from their customers. Data concerning that supply chain can be commercially sensitive. For example, 
	a transport company may not wish their customer to know that they sub contracted part of the journey to another partner. It can be a security risk too. The 
	locations of warehouses and distribution centers where large stocks of particular items are held can be a target for the insertion of counterfeit goods into 
	legitimate supplies.</p>
	<p>A downstream party such as a retailer, pharmacy or end consumer may have a legitimate reason or in some cases a legal requirement to know that
	each product is genuine and can be traced back to the genuine manufacturer through an unbroken chain of custody, without any gaps or inconsistencies
	in the traceability data.</p>
	<p>A downstream party may also want to check whether the product ID and serial number were actually issued by the manufacturer. However, the manufacturer may
	not want to provide such information about valid serial numbers to its competitors or counterfeiters, so there may be a need to control access to such services.</p>
	<p>For these reasons and more, identifiers for business partners, locations and transactions often need to be obfuscated, and the data exchanged between 
	partners is typically restricted both in terms of its content and in terms of access to it. This is especially true when a manufacturer does not want its 
	competitors to know the actual source of the ingredients or components in its products. Different parties will be interested in different things too. For 
	example, a retailer may be interested in knowing where a particular shipment is and when it is expected to arrive; a consumer of a food product is more likely 
	to be concerned about the original source of the item and the total number of food miles in the product.</p>
	<p>Decentralized Identifiers could be generated by sending and receiving parties at each stage in the chain. This would preserve anonymity yet prove control
	of the identified shipment at each stage and, via the DID Document, provide access to data (subject to authorization) pertaining to each transaction without
	enabling correlation across multiple shipments or other sensitive information.</p>

    <h3>Digital Permanent Resident Card</h3>
    <p>Sam is a long term immigrant to the United States who just received

      Immigration Services (USCIS). Along with his notice is directions for
      downloading and using a digital version of his physical card, including
      a one-time activation code. After getting a digital wallet, he visits
      the USCIS website, signs in, and uses his activation code to get a

      demonstrates control over the DID to prove to USCIS that the identifier
      is under Sam's control. USCIS issues a newly minted digital credential
      with the subject identifier set to the provided DID.</p>
    <p> Now, Sam can use

      <h3>Importing retro toys</h3>
      <p>Jodie is operations manager at ImportersRUs, a boutique importer
        specializing in small run retro products manufactured in Asia.
        Last year she got her big break when she licensed the right to make "Retro"
        Lima Bean Babies, a huge collector phenomenon in the 1990s. As long as her
        products had a distinct, visible tag with "R" on one side and "Retro" on
        the other, she could manufacture anything from the Lima Bean Babies catalog.</p>
      <p>
        To handle fulfilment, Jodie works in small batches
        with a large number of different products and
        frequently changes manufacturers to stay on top of shifting materials,
        transportation, and tariff costs.</p>
      <p>Jodie registers a DID with US Customs and Border Protection (US CBP) for
        ImportersRUs (demonstrating proof-of-control as she does) and secures a digital
        license from Tie Enterprises (owners of the Lima Bean Babies trademark and designs)
        issued to her DID and signed using a DID that Tie Enterprises has also
        registered with US CBP.
        For her manufacturers, Jodie cryptographically delegates the digital license to
        individual manufacturers using the DID (which is both the subject of the license
        <em>and</em> known to US CBP). Those manufacturers are responsible for getting
        the product to the port of Los Angeles. They, in turn, cryptographically delegate
        their licenses to logistics firms to actually move the product from their facility
        to Los Angeles, while maintaining cryptographic verifiability of both the
        original license, and the chain of delegations.</p>
      <p>When her products reach the United States, CBP can automatically review the
        digital manifest filed for entry and each of the delegations to verify that this given
        batch of products are, in fact, officially licensed Lima Bean Baby products.
      </p>
      <p>This digitally verifiable provenance of
        her license streamlines access through US Customs, regardless of her supply
        chain, without reducing the effectiveness of CBP at fighting the illegal
        import of pirated product.</p>

		(forming a <a>DID URL</a>), dereferencing will return the resource pointed to from the named service endpoint, which was
		discovered by resolving the DID to its DID Document and looking up the endpoint by name. In this way, a

      their use. (Anti-censorship and Sustainable).</dd>
  <dt id="f2">2. Can't be administratively denied</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers can't be denied or taken away by administrative

        interfering. (Anti-censorship).</dd>
  <dt id="f3">3. Minimized rents</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers don't incur ongoing expenses if unused nor on a per 
        transaction basis. Fees based on updates—which incurs network and 
        computational costs to verify—are considered "minimal". (Anti-exploitation 
        and Sustainable).</dd>
  <dt id="f4">4. No vendor lock in</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers are not dependent on any given vendor. Vendor-specific 
        identifiers restrict usage to that which is acceptable to the vendor and 
        may allow vendors to extract disproportionate rents for usage. 
        (Anti-exploitation, Privacy, and Sustainable).</dd>
  <dt id="f5">5. Self-issued, self-managed</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers are created and managed by the subject of the identifier. 
        They are not assigned, given, sold, or rented to the individual using them. 
        The party relying on the identifier for identification, authentication, and 
        authorization, does not need to manage the creation, update, and recovery of 
        these identifiers. (Anti-censorship, Ease of use, and Privacy)</dd>
  <dt id="f6">6. Streamlined rotation</dt>
    <dd>When authentication materials need to be updated, these identifiers can 
        update without direct intervention with requesting parties and with minimal 
        individual interaction. (Ease of use)</dd>
  <dt id="f7">7. No phone home</dt>
    <dd>When using these identifiers, there is no need to contact the issuer of the 
        identifier to verify it. Verification and authentication can occur without 
        further communication with the issuer. (Privacy)</dd>
  <dt id="f8">8. Preempt/limit trackable data trails</dt>
    <dd>As &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; and other session/state-tracking mechanisms were gradually turned into scaffolding
	    for unwanted or collusive tracking in the evolution of the web stack, so too might any new data exchange
	    or communication systems unwittingly facilitate unwanted tracking based on new data trails. Resistance 
	    to these kinds of surveillance exploits need to be designed into new systems.</dd>
  <dt id="f9">9. Cryptographic future proofing</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers are capable of being updated as technology evolves. Current 
        cryptography techniques are known to be susceptible to quantum computational 
        attacks. Future-proofed identifiers provide a means to continue using the same 
        identifier with updated, advanced authentication and authorization technologies. 
        (Sustainable)</dd>
  <dt id="f10">10. Survives organizational mortality</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers survive the demise of the organization that issued them. They 
        usefulness of these identifiers survive organizations going out of business, 
        being purchased (and potentially losing domain names or root credentials), and 
        even the internal decay of an organization that no longer has the ability to 
        verify the authenticity of records they once issued.</dd>
  <dt id="f11">11. Survives deployment end-of-life</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers are usable even after the systems deployed by requesting parties 
        move past their useful lifetime. They are robust against technology fads and can 
        seamlessly work with both legacy and next-generation systems.</dd>
  <dt id="f12">12. Survives relationship with service provider</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers are not dependent on the tenure of the relationship with a 
        service provider. This contrasts with identifiers like service-centric emails, 
        e.g., joe@example.com, which when used as identifiers in other systems can cause 
        problems when individuals no longer use the service provider.</dd>
  <dt id="f13">13. Cryptographic authentication and communication</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers enable cryptographic techniques to authenticate individuals 
        and to secure communications with the subject of the identifier, typically using 
        public-private key pairs.</dd>
  <dt id="f14">14. Service discovery</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers allow requesting parties to look up available service endpoints 
        for interacting with the subject of the identifier. (Ease of use and Sustainable)</dd>
  <dt id="f15">15. Registry agnostic</dt>

      <h3>Decentralized Corporate Identifiers (enterprise)</h3>
      <section>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
          There are many types of identifiers that corporations use today
          including tax identification numbers (e.g. 238-42-3893), Legal
          Entity Identifiers (e.g. 5493000IBP32UQZ0KL24), Data Universal
          Numbering System identifiers (a.k.a. DUNS Number, e.g. 150483782),
	  Global Location Number (e.g. 9501101020016),
          and many more that communicate the unique identity of an organization.
          None of these numbers enable an organization to self-issue an
          identifier or to use the number to cryptographically authenticate or
          digitally sign agreements. Business to business
          and business to customer transactions might be conducted with more
	  efficiency and with greater assurance of the validity of the
	  transaction if a mechanism to self-issue cryptographic identifiers
	  were created.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="didEnterpriseDescrption">
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
          A North American government would like to ensure that the supply
          chain that feeds electronic products into the country is secure. As
          a result, a new method of submitting digital documentation to Customs is enabled that requires that all documentation is
	  provided as machine-readable digitally signed data with proof of provenance from supply chain partners whose identities
	  are themselves known to a high degree of certainty. Digitally signed documentation
          is collected at each stage of the manufacturing, packaging, and
          shipping process. This documentation is then submitted to Customs
          upon the product's entry into the country where all digital signatures
          are verified on the documentation. Some aspects of the signed
          documentation, such as firmware hashes and checksums, are then used
          by Customs and downstream customers to verify that the products have
          not been tampered with after leaving the manufacturing facility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Decentralized Identifiers should ensure 1) low
          management overhead for the government, 2) self-management of
          identifiers and cryptographic key material, and 3) a competitive
          marketplace.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="didEnterpriseChallenges">
        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p>
          The requirement of downstream customers to use the same documentation
          and digital signature mechanisms that were provided to Customs is
          potentially problematic in this scenario. Governments often create ad-hoc
          solutions for their import solutions, which make securing the global
          supply chain difficult as each government has their own method of
          securing the supply chain and identifying corporations that downstream
          customers need to integrate with. If you are a global company, that
          means integrating with many supply chain systems (each with different
          capabilities). As such, any securing of the supply chain with downstream
          customers must then depend on the country-specific corporate
          identification and PKI solution, which leads to ad-hoc solutions that
          drive up the cost of doing business across borders.
        </p>
        <p>
          A supply chain identifier solution that is simple, self-administered,
          built on global standards, is flexible in the cryptographic mechanisms
          used to authenticate, and can be used by governments and downstream
          customers with little to no modification to the regional government
          or corporate systems does not exist today.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="didEnterpriseDistinctions">
        <h4>Distinctions</h4>
        <p>
          Many Decentralized Identifier use cases focus on Self-Sovereign
          Identity and individuals. This use case focuses on organizations and
          their departments as entities that would also benefit from
          Decentralized Identifiers.

      <h3>Life-long, recipient-managed Credentials (education)</h3>
	    <p class="focalContributor">Contributed by Kim Hamilton-Duffy</p>
      <section id="eduBackground">
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>Educational Verifiable Credentials [[VC-DATA-MODEL]] offer benefits over traditional
          educational credentials in that the recipient is able to store and
          share their credentials, and a third party may independently verify
          the credential (including authenticating the identity of the recipient),
		  without necessarily consulting the issuer, and without dependence on
		  centuries old treaty-based bureaucratic process for the international
      verification of credentials. This provides the promise of recipient-owned
		  long-lived credentials that the recipient may use in any country,
		  even if the issuing institution goes out of business.
        </p>
        <p> However, traditional public-private key pair-based identifiers
			present challenges for rotating keys, especially if
			the identifier in a credential is simply the public key (with
			the private key used for authentication).</p>
        <ol>
    		<li>With the public key embedded in the digitally signed credential, 
				it is literally impossible to update the signing key; a recipient 
				must  contact the issuer and request re-issuing with a new 
				identifier. If the issuer is not reachable, or is unwilling 
				or unable to issue a new credential, the recipient cannot 
				update the cryptographic material.</li>
			<li>If the credential relies on a centralized key registry or
				authority for managing rotation, then that registry becomes
				the centralized point of failure. This may or may not be an
				improvement, especially for longer held credentials.</li>
			<li>If the credential's cryptographic technology becomes outdated,
				there is no way to update the credential to use a more robust
				technology; a recipient must contact the issuer for reissuance.</li>
		  </ol>
        <p>The key rotation is particularly problematic for credentials
            expected to last a lifetime. It should be anticipated that
			a given individual will change their key management strategy and
		    systems several times over the course of their life, e.g. relying
		    on a cloud wallet, a mobile wallet, or a dedicated hardware wallet,
		    as their needs change.</p>
        <p>By issuing an educational credential to a recipient's DID, the
			recipient has the ability to prove ownership of a credential even
			if the cryptographic material used for authenticating changes over time.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="eduDescription">
        <h4>Description</h4>
	      <p>When Sally earned her master&rsquo;s degree at the <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>,
		      she received a digital diploma that contained a decentralized identifier she provided. This digital diploma is signed using a decentralized
		      identifier which has been published and verified by the University of Oxford.
			Over time, she updates the cryptographic material associated with that
			DID to use her latest hardware wallet, with biometric protections and a
			quantum resistant algorithm. A decade after  graduation, she applies for
			a job in Japan, for which she provides her digital diploma by uploading
			it to the prospective employee&rsquo;s website. To verify she is the
			actual recipient of that degree, she uses the decentralized identifier
			to authenticate, using her current hardware wallet (with rotated keys).
			In addition to the fact that her name matches the name on the diploma,
			the cryptographic authentication provides a robust verification of her
			claim, allowing the employer to rely on Sally&rsquo;s assertion that she
			earned a master&rsquo;s degree from the stated university without having to contact the university directly.</p>

        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
          Alicia wants help with her urinary tract infection (UTI) and is a bit
          touchy about her privacy. In the old days, she would have to make an
          appointment in-person and get a paper prescription to take to a
          pharmacy. She wants to save money and have peace of mind.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="prescriptionsDescription">
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
          Alicia is in a state that allows an online service to diagnose and
          prescribe medication. She uses the identity wallet on her smartphone
          to register with the online medical practice. She tells the online
          practice her name is Althea (a pseudonym)
          with password-less authentication and a verified driver's license
          credential to prove that she's a resident of the state. The remote physician,
          Barkley, is licensed by the state Board of Medicine and credentialed by the
          online service. He's securely signed in using the
          identity wallet on his smartphone. Barkley issues Alicia a digital
          prescription in the form of a verifiable credential and allows Alicia
          to download it however she pleases. Alicia is a librarian and trusts
          her local public library to erase their logs as allowed by law. She
          uses one of their computers to sign-in and do all of this. She snaps
          a picture of the QR code that is the prescription to take to the
          pharmacy. Connor, the licensed pharmacist, scans the prescription
          QR code and fills the prescription. Alicia pays cash.

      </section>


      <section id="prescriptionsChallenges">
        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p>The challenge of this particular use-case is that only Barkley and
          Connor are verified identities and accountable for their interaction
          with Alicia. Alicia can be anonymous or pairwise-pseudonymous with both
          Barkley and Connor and everything just works. Alicia, Barkley, and Connor
          all keep separate and legally authentic copies of the records of their
          interaction in case of dispute.

      <section id="prescriptionsDistinction">
        <h4>Distinction</h4>
        <p>
          The Prescription use-case is a common and high-value example of
          privacy engineering as we shift to convenient and cost-effective
          online commerce among licensed and unlicensed individuals as peers.
          Barkley and Connor benefit by reducing or even eliminating the influence
          of their respective institutions or employers and therefore make more
          money. They pass some savings to Alicia who also gets increased peace
          of mind.

      <h3>Digital Executor (law)</h3>
      <section id="lawBackground">
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
          Today, when people die, there are no standard technologies for heirs,
          executors, or probate courts to properly take control of an individual's
          online accounts and digital assets. With a DID linked to accounts and
          assets, a DID owner could define a trigger for a third party to assume
          control over the DID Document. Ideally, this trigger would specify (a)
          an oracle (how to know the death/incapacity occurred), (b) a means for
          the new owner to assert control, and (c) appropriate checks and
          accountability.
        </p>

      <section id="lawDescription">
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
          Kathy uses DIDs to manage her authentications to various services.
          As part of her estate planning, she generates a unique credential
          that she gives to her attorney, Gloria, with provisions specified in
          her will, which initially lists Mike as the digital executor. With
          appropriate obfuscation, that credential is specified in multiple DID
          documents as a probate authority, with the authorization to change the
          master key in case of death, which shall be recorded publicly, on chain,
          as a notarized invocation of the probate authority. As it happens,
          Kathy had a falling out with Mike and notified Gloria just two weeks
          before her death that her friend Miyake should now be her digital
          executor. Upon Kathy's death, Gloria uses the probate credential to
          publicly record the assertion of probate and to replace the DID's master
          key with a new key, controlled by Miyake, who lives in Japan (Kathy,
          Gloria, and Mike live in the United States). Now, any system using
          Kathy's DIDs for authentication can programmatically recognized Miyake's
          authority <em>and</em> specifically know that Kathy's credentials were
          modified under a assertion of probate.
        </p>

      </section>



      <section id="lawChallenges">
        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p>
          The late date change in digital executorship from Mike to Miyake
          could be problematic if Kathy had directly listed Mike's credential
          in the DID Document. Because she instead chose to rely on her attorney,
          Kathy has a more flexible way to direct her wishes, while still
          leveraging the collective control over her authenticated logins to
          various services. In addition, Miyake's geographic location could
          make it hard for them to travel to the United States and may make it
          difficult to provide proof of identity traditionally used by U.S. courts.
          Also, because Gloria invokes the probate mechanism, Miyake need only
          provide a suitable credential at that time; he did not need to create
          and maintain a credential over a long period of time (as would be the
          case if Gloria weren't involved).

          Multiple DIDs with a common, blinded authority for probate assumption

      <h3>Single Sign On (security)</h3>
      <section id="ssoBackground">
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
          Passwords are notoriously misused ("123456"), stolen from the
          supposedly-secure database on the server-side, easy to forget when
          sufficiently secure, and never the last word in authentication for
          forgotten password situations. Proving control of a DID can replace
          storage and retrieval of a shared secret.

        <h4>Description</h4>
<p class="ednote">This section in particular needs review to ensure it carries
information relevant to the WG's work.</p>
        <p>Use a DID as a single-sign-on to a Web site, for example between
          a Web page and a Web browser with a mobile identity app. When desirable,
          the relationship can add a shared secret for two-factor authentication (2FA).</p>
        <p>Detailed aspects of this use case are out of scope for the Decentralized
        Identifier Working Group but they have been explored elsewhere [[DID-Auth]].

          cases like the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-spring2018/blob/master/draft-documents/did_auth_draft.md#did-auth-architecture-6-web-page-and-web-browser">

          Credential Handler API</a>.

          Use DID as single-sign-on to a website, using one of the variants of DID Auth (see [[DID-AUTH-INTRO]]).
          This can be implemented using different protocols and APIs, such as [[DID-AUTH-OIDC-SIOP]] or [[CREDENTIAL-HANDLER-API]].
          When desirable, the relationship can add
          a shared secret for 2FA.

          subsequent ascension without starting another socket?).-->

<!--        <p>
          Note that what is stored on the server-side is a DID, so in cases
          where a successful attack reads (but does not mutate) the database,
          all that is revealed is linkage of the DID to use the site (so
          probably as a consequence the user should spawn a unique DID to reveal
          to that site), and any 2FA secret (which should be a random number for
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm">TOTP</a>,
