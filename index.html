    </ol>
    <p>Although existing identifiers may display some of these characteristics, none currently displays all four.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="sotd"></section>
    <section id="intro">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The need for globally unique identifier schemes has been addressed many 
      times. Globally unique ID schemes typically rely on a central authority 
      controlling a 'root' space that is then delegated to local organizations 
      who in turn delegate to further organizations who eventually add the final 
      string to complete the identifer. Even if we restrict ourseleves to online 
      identifiers, there are many examples of this.</p><ul>
  <li>IANA controls the root namespace of the Internet's Domain Name System; 
      registrars operate the top level domains and then license specific domain 
      names to their clients, and it's these clients who create the actual 
      identifiers for online resources (URLs). The example below shows who 
      controls what in a typical URL.

<pre class="example">

                IANA
                 ↓
https://example.com/page.html
           ↑           ↑
        Registrar   Licensee
</pre></li>
  <li><abbr title="Digital Object Identifier">DOI</abbr>s have the form 
    <code>10.{registrant}/{suffix}</code> where 'registrant' is defined by the 
    DOI organization and the suffix by the registrant.</li>
  <li>Global Trade Item Numbers (GTINs) seen on many of the world's barcodes 
      are managed in a similar way, as are Legal Entity Identifiers, 
      <abbr title="International Standard Book Number">ISBN</a>s and more.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In all these cases, ultimately, there is a central authority on which the 
   identifier system depends. Those central authorities go to significant 
    efforts to make their identifiers persistent and resolvable, however, 
    should they cease to exist, the long term integrity of the identifier 
    is at least questionable to a greater or lesser extent. For as long as 
    those organizations exist (and they are generally well established with no 
    immediate threat to their survival), the way to assess whether a particular 
    identifier is in some way 'valid' is to query the issuing authority.</p>
  <p>These factors point to a need in some circumstances for a globally unique 
    identifier that is 'self sovereign', that is, one that does not depend on 
    any issuing authority. Universally unique identifiers (<a>UUID</a>s) [[RFC4122]] 
    fulfill this role, however, there is no way to <em>prove</em> control of 
    a <abbr title="Universally unique identifier">UUID</abbr>.</p>
  <p>This document sets out use cases and requirements for a new kind of 
    identifier that meets all these basic requirements:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>decentralized</strong>: there should be no central issuing 
        agency;</li>
        <li><strong>persistent</strong>: the identifier should be inherently 
        persistent, not requiring the continued operation of an underling organization;</li>
        <li><strong>crytopgraphically verifiable</strong>: it should be possible 
        to prove control of the identifier cryptographically;</li>
        <li><strong>resolvable</strong>: it should be possible to discover 
        metadata about the identifier.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Existing Work</h3>
    <p>The use cases and requirements set out below have not been created <i>a 
        priori</i>. Substantial work has been done within W3C and elsewhere 
        leading, in particular, to <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/08/did-20190828/">Decentralized 
        Identifiers (DIDs) Data Model and Syntaxes</a> published as a Community 
        Group Report by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">Credentials 
        Community Group</a> in August 2019. That work provides a framework &mdash; 
        a set of concepts &mdash; that have proved to be useful when discussing 
        <abbr title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>s and the problems they 
        can solve (see below). Those concepts are used within this document to 
        set out the detail of the problem that the Decentralized Identifier Working 
        Group is <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/09/did-wg-charter">chartered</a> 
        to solve. It is the nature of the standardization process that these 
        terms may be modified within the standard itself and therefore, their 
        use here should not be seen as authoritative.</p>
      </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id="concepts">Concepts of Decentralized Identity</h2>
	<p class="issue" data-number="39">Terminology in this opening prose is being discussed, in particular
	the term 'relying party'</p>
        <p>A decentralized system will enable several key actions by three 
		distinct entities: the Controller, the <span class="highlight">Relying Party</span>, and the Subject.</p>
        <p>Controllers create and control <abbr title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>s, 
		while <span class="highlight">Relying Parties</span> rely on <abbr title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>s 
          as an identifier for  interactions related to the <a>DID Subject</a>.</p>
        <p>The Subject is the entity referred to by the <abbr title="Decentralized 
          Identifier">DID</abbr>, which can be anything: a person,  an organization, 
          a device, a location, even a concept. Typically, the Subject is also 
          the Controller, but in cases of guardianship, agents (human or software),  
          and inanimate Subjects, this is not possible. As such, the Subject has 
		no functional  role. When the Subject is, in fact, the <a>DID Controller</a>, we 
          consider the action to  be taken by the Controller on their own behalf 
          as the Subject. When the Subject  is not the DID Controller, the Controller 
          is said to be taking action on behalf of the Subject, such as when an 
          employee manages a <abbr title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr> 
          on behalf of their employer  or a parent uses a <abbr title="Decentralized 
          Identifier">DID</abbr> on behalf of their child.</p>
	    <p>The DID Controller and <span class="highlight">Relying Party</span> may be individuals or interactive 
          systems, but for simplicity in this document, we refer to both as if 
          they were individual  persons performing these actions. </p>
	  <p>Only a <a>DID Controller</a> can perform the actions that control a <abbr 
          title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>, however, anyone can act 
	  as a <span class="highlight">Relying Party</span> for any <abbr title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr> 
          they know, including the DID Controller, should they wish to inspect or 
          verify their own <abbr title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>.</p>
        <p>This use case document defines these actions in terms of the eventual 
          systems we anticipate using the resultant specification.</p>

        <p>Perhaps the most salient point about <a>Decentralized Identifiers</a> is 
        that there are no "Identity Providers". Instead, this role is subsumed 
        in the decentralized systems that Controllers use to manage <abbr 
        title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>s and, in turn, <span class="highlight">Relying 
		Parties</span> use to apply <abbr title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>s. 
        These  decentralized systems, which we refer to as <abbr 
        title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr> registries, are designed to  
        operate independently from any particular service provider and hence, 
        free from  any given platform authority. It is anticipated that <abbr 
        title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>s will be registered using 
        distributed ledger technology (<a>DLT</a>). 

        <p>In practice, the definition and operation of all current decentralized 
        systems retain some elements of centralized control. Depending on the 
        criteria one uses to evaluate such systems &mdash; from who controls 
        the most widely used code base to who controls  the specification &mdash; 
        where a system resides on the spectrum of centralized and decentralized 
        varies. However, the design of any decentralized identity system is 
        separate from the  academic debate about how decentralized it may be 
        in practice.</p>
        <p>The use cases presented below make use of a number of high level 
        concepts as follows.</p>

<div class="note" title="Shared terminology">
  <p>This section is automatically synchronised with the terminology section in
    the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">DID Core</a> specification.</p></div>

  <div data-include="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/terms.html"
      data-oninclude="restrictReferences">
  </div>

  <p class="issue" data-number="14">The term DID registry is under discussion within the Working Group.
  A particular point to bear in mind is that not all DID methods require DIDs to be registered to be functional.</p>

<p>When we refer to <em>methods</em> and <em>registries</em>, we mean <a><abbr 
  title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr> methods</a> and <a><abbr title="Decentralized 
  Identifier">DID</abbr> registries</a>. A working assumption for the use cases is that all 
  <abbr title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>s resolve to <abbr title="Decentralized 
  Identifier">DID</abbr> Documents. <abbr title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr> 
  Documents contain the cryptographic material to perform the functions related to 
  that particular <abbr title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>, including 
  associated proof methods and any service endpoints, that is, services that can 
  make use of the <abbr title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>.</p>

        <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <section id="onlineShopper">
          <h3>Online shopper</h3>
        <p>Traditionally, a shopper frequents a trusted retailer and can physically hold the products they wish to purchase. 
		The product and the information about it is trusted because it is put there by the brand, and the shopper trusts that 
		the retailer has received the product through trusted supply chain partners. Today, there is a multitude of 
		channels and platforms for selling and buying products. The internet has changed consumer purchasing behavior 
		as more and more commerce is conducted digitally. This introduces new challenges for brands, retailers and consumers, 
		as the relationship is not as direct as the traditional mode of shopping.</p>
        <p>Online shopping, especially through 3rd party marketplaces, creates a proliferation of digital records about that product 
		across platforms. Unlike a physical product, a consumer cannot be assured that the record (and the information 
		presented about that product) came from the brand or other authoritative source. Product identification and information 
		and the source of the product itself is less reliable, and introduces trust issues with representations of products 
		bought and sold online. Additionally, unique identification is critical to business processes, but also to online 
		purchasing. Very often two different products share the same identifier across the supply chain, and so what a 
		consumer purchases and what ultimately is received may be different.</p>
        <p>Mechanisms are required for the following to provide trust in the digital representation of a product across platforms:</p>
	<ol>
          <li>validation of the legitimacy of an online listing &mdash; in particular on third party marketplaces;</li>
          <li>assurance of identification uniqueness and key identifying data element accuracy.</li>

	<section id="vehicleAssemblies"><h3>Vehicle assemblies</h3>
	<p>Manufactured goods are usually the output of multiple processes carried out by multiple actors. Think of a vehicle 
	(be it a ship, a train, a car or a plane) with 
	components and assemblies of components from multiple suppliers that are then added to the emerging vehicle as it makes its 
	way along the production line. During the lifetime of that vehicle, components will be replaced and serviced, and this work 
	can be carried out by any number of different agents.</p>
	<p>A mechanism that allows each agent to make independent assertions about their work – the components created or replaced, 
	the tests carried out, which part was married up to which other part and so on – would allow the complete manufacturing and 
	service history of the vehicle to be computed.</p>
	<p>The independent aspect is important. A decentralized identifier created and applied to each component or assembly can be 
	cryptographically verified without the need to call home to a supply company that may or may not continue to exist. Moreover, there 
	is no requirement for the overall vehicle manufacturer to maintain an aggregated database  concerning a vehicle that, in a 
	traditional system, is not only a single point of failure but that is immediately out of date as soon as the vehicle goes in 
	for its first service. A decentralized system allows each component of the vehicle to have its own history, its own credentials 
	and its own lifecycle, independent of other components and the vehicle – or vehicles – of which it is a part over time.</p>
	<p>The vehicle itself has its own identifier too. This would allow that particular vehicle to be a reference for the components 
	and any licensing, insurance, servicing etc. Again, the decentralized nature of DIDs promises <em>subsequent owners</em> control 
	over the identifier without dependency on any central agency allowing the maintenance record(s) to transition smoothly throughout 
	the entire lifecycle of the vehicle.</p>

	<section id="edv"><h3>Encrypted Data Vault</h3>
	<p>Data stored in the cloud is typically visible to the cloud platform operator, even when flagged as being ‘only accessible to 
	you.’ For data to be stored in the cloud – in other words, on someone else’s computer – and for it to be only accessible to the data 
	owner, it must be encrypted. A Decentralized Identifier that leads to information with which a user can prove control of the 
	identifier without resort to a centralized authority could enable substitutable encrypted cloud storage. That is, the data owner 
	would be able to change cloud storage provider, take their encrypted data with them, and still offer fine-grained access control 
	to specific parties or their delegates. Associating cryptographic information with the DID would allow the data owner to change 
	their keys and <em>still</em> be able to control access without having to decrypt and re-encrypt it.</p>
	<p class="shortUcContributor">Contributed by Digital Bazaar &amp; Transmute</p>
	</section> <!-- Encrypted Data Vault-->
	      
	<section id="accessingServiceEndpoints"><h3>Accessing service endpoints</h3>
	<p>A Decentralized Identifier resolves to information relevant to that identifier including service endpoints – typically 
	APIs that allow some sort of interaction with the identified item. For example, a service endpoint might provide corporate 
	master data about the item which in turn could be provided as a self-signed verifiable credential. The decentralized nature 
	of the identifier is important here as it can continue to act as an entry to that master data even if the manufacturer goes 
	out of business.</p>
	<p>Another example would be parking spaces identified by a DID and connected to barriers. The static data directly associated 
	with the parking space, such as its GPS position, can be made publicly available, perhaps leveraging schema.org, together with 
	details of the secure service endpoint that facilitates interaction with the parking space’s barrier. The parking space may be 
	owned by the local authority but the barrier is likely to be operated by a contracted third party and that contracted party 
	can be replaced at any time without needing to change the parking space’s identifier.</p>

	<section id="vcEcosystem"><h3>Identifiers in an ecosystem of verifiable credentials (VCs)</h3>
	<p>Remembering the <a href="#abstract">4 essential characteristics of a decentralized identifier</a>, there are situations 
		where DIDs offer tangible benefits over existing identifier schemes. For example:</p><ul>
	<li>Verifiable credential issuers publishing the list of subject attributes that they are authoritative for (their 
		authoritative nature can be proven).</li>
	<li>In similar vein, VC issuers may publish authoritative schemas for the types of credential that they issue.</li>
	<li>Terms of use or other policy constraints that might apply to issued VCs.</li>
	<li>A published list of the public keys used to sign credentials becomes useful in a chain of trust if that list can itself 
		be verified.</li>
	<li>The controller of a decentralized identifier can rotate their cryptographic keys, either to overcome their existing keys 
		being compromised or the development of superior technology. This does not affect the validity or proveability of any 
		verifiable credentials associated with that identifier.</li>

      <h2>DID Actions</h2>
        <p>Here are the thirteen (13) actions envisioned in earlier work by 
		<a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">Credentials Community Group</a> as being necessarily supported by 
		<abbr title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>s. In the diagram, actions have been grouped by Create, 
		Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) as well as Use.</p>

		<p class="issue" data-number="14">This section refers to recording in a registry. I've changed it to say 
			'may be' but this can only be finalized when Issue-14 is resolved.</p>
        <p>Controllers create DIDs, uniquely binding cryptographic proofs with the identifier, typically using 
		public-private key-pairs. These DIDs may be recorded in a registry in such a manner as to be able to 
		resolve to a  DID Document. The DID Document may be dynamically and deterministically generated through resolution or 
		it may be explicitly constructed as a  stand-alone resource and either stored or referenced in the registry. 
		In this scenario, the process will need access to any registry, ideally a decentralized system, and like the 
		rest of the DID CRUD actions, it shold be possible to create the DID without interaction with any particular authority.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="present">
            <h2>Present</h2>
        <p>DIDs are <a>URI</a>s, which is to say a string of characters. As such, they may be presented in the same manner as 
		URIs by simply transmitting  or presenting that string of characters. There is no requirement, however, 
		that DIDs be human readable. Thus they may contain long, complex numbers represented in  various formats. For 
		ease of use, implementations may rely on data carriers such as QR codes [[QR]] for ease of capture using a camera-enabled device 
		such as a smart phone.</p>

        <section id="authenticate">
        <h2>Authenticate</h2>
		<p><span class="highlight">Relying Parties</span> may wish to prove that the individual presenting a DID is in fact its <a>DID Controller</a> or 
		specified as a Controller for a  particular service endpoint. This authentication process should use the cryptographic  
		material in the DID Document to test if the claimed Controller can, in fact, prove  control, typically through some 
		sort of challenge-response. DID Documents and methods may allow for separate proofs for different service endpoints,  
		distinct from update and delete actions. This separation would support transactional proofs that are expected to be 
		used frequently, while controlling proofs are expected to be used rarely.</p>

        <h2>Sign</h2>
		<p>Using cryptographic material associated with that found in a  <a>DID Document</a>, <a>DID Controller</a>s may sign digital

		authenticity of the asset. In this way, it should be possible to refer to the asset as "signed  by the DID".</p>
        </section>
        <section id="resolve">
        <h2>Resolve</h2>
        <p>The first step in using a DID for anything other than presentation is to resolve the DID to a specific <a>DID Document</a>,

        <p>Dereferencing a DID uses the material in its DID Document to return a resource. The expectation is that, by default, dereferencing 
		a DID without a reference to a service endpoint will return the <a>DID Document</a> itself. When a DID is combined with a 
		<code>service</code> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/WD-did-core-20191113/#generic-did-parameter-names">parameter</a> 
		(forming a <a>DID URL</a>), dereferencing will return the resource pointed to from the named service endpoint, which was 
		discovered by resolving the DID to its DID Document and looking up the endpoint by name. In this way, a 
		<span class="highlight">Relying Party</span> may dynamically discover and  interact with the current service endpoints for a 
		given DID. Services can therefore be given persistent identifiers that do not change even when the underlying service 
		endpoints change.</p>

        <h2>Verify Signature</h2>
        <p>Given a digital asset signed by a DID, a <span style="background-color:yellow">Relying Party</span> may use the

        <section id="rotate">
        <h2>Rotate</h2>
        <p>Controllers may rotate the cryptographic material for a DID  by updating the DID Document as 
		<span class="highlight">recorded in its registry</span>. Different methods should be able to handle this differently, but 
		the result would be an update to the core cryptographic proof required to prove control of the DID and the DID Document.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="modifyServiceEndpoint">
        <h2>Modify Service Endpoint</h2>
		<p><a>DID Controllers</a> should be able to change service endpoints associated with a DID, including the proof mechanism 
		for authenticating as the Subject for any  given endpoint. The process for doing this is method specific, but is designed to 
		allow Controllers to make these changes without necessarily changing the primary proof mechanism for control of the DID itself.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="forwardMigrate">
        <h2>Forward / Migrate</h2>
		<p>To support interoperability, some methods may provide a way for <a>DID Controllers</a> to record in their registry (by updating the 
		DID Document), that the  DID should be redirected to another DID, which now has full authority to represent the originating 
		DID. This mechanism would allow <a>DID Controllers</a> to migrate a DID  from one method or registry to another.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="recover">
        <h2>Recover</h2>
        <p>Some methods may provide a means for recovering control of a DID if its existing private cryptographic material is lost. These 
		means will vary by method but can include social recovery, <span class="highlight">multi-signature</span>, 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir's_Secret_Sharing">Shamir sharing</a>, or pre-rotated  keys. In general, 
		recovery triggers a rotation to a new proof, allowing the <a>DID Controller</a> of that new proof to recover control of the 
		DID without interacting  with any <span class="highlight">Relying Parties</span>.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="audit">
        <h2>Audit</h2>
        <p>Some methods may provide an explicit audit trail of all <abbr title="Create, Read, Update, Delete/Deactivate">CRUD</abbr> 
		actions on that DID, including a timestamp for when the actions took place. For distributed ledger-based 
		registries, this audit trail is fundamental to the way  the ledgers record transactions. This would allow
		<span class="highlight">relying parties</span> to see, for example, how recently a DID was rotated or its service 
		endpoints updated, which may inform certain analytics regarding the reliability of the DID's  cryptographic material.</p>
	</section>
        <section id="deactivate">
        <h2>Deactivate</h2>
        <p>Instead of deleting a DID, Controllers should be able to deactivate a DID such that downstream processes like authentication and 
		dereferencing are no longer functional.  Most decentralized systems cannot guarantee actual deletion of a record.  
		Indeed, distributed ledgers are often touted as "immutable". Methods should define deactivation processes to achieve 
		the same effect as deletion. The mechanisms for deactivation will vary based on the method.</p>

  <dt id="f1">1. Inter-jurisdictional</dt>
	<dd>Inter-jurisdictional identifiers do not depend on the legal jurisdiction

      of fidelity or reliability. No jurisdiction is directly able to prevent 
      their use. (Anti-censorship and Sustainable).</dd>
  <dt id="f2">2. Can't be administratively denied</dt>

        interfering. (Anti-censorship).</dd>
  <dt id="f3">3. Minimized rents</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers don't incur ongoing expenses if unused nor on a per 
        transaction basis. Fees based on updates—which incurs network and 
        computational costs to verify—are considered "minimal". (Anti-exploitation 
        and Sustainable).</dd>
  <dt id="f4">4. No vendor lock in</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers are not dependent on any given vendor. Vendor-specific 
        identifiers restrict usage to that which is acceptable to the vendor and 
        may allow vendors to extract disproportionate rents for usage. 
        (Anti-exploitation, Privacy, and Sustainable).</dd>
  <dt id="f5">5. Self-issued, self-managed</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers are created and managed by the subject of the identifier. 
        They are not assigned, given, sold, or rented to the individual using them. 
        The party relying on the identifier for identification, authentication, and 
        authorization, does not need to manage the creation, update, and recovery of 
        these identifiers. (Anti-censorship, Ease of use, and Privacy)</dd>
  <dt id="f6">6. Streamlined rotation</dt>
    <dd>When authentication materials need to be updated, these identifiers can 
        update without direct intervention with relying parties and with minimal 
        individual interaction. (Ease of use)</dd>
  <dt id="f7">7. No phone home</dt>
    <dd>When using these identifiers, there is no need to contact the issuer of the 
        identifier to verify it. Verification and authentication can occur without 
        further communication with the issuer. (Privacy)</dd>
  <dt id="f8">8. No surveillance capitalism</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers limit the effectiveness of surveillance capitalism by 
        minimizing cross-service correlatability. Individuals may use these 
        identifiers at multiple service providers without their activity being 
        tracked for collusion or third party embedded surveillance techniques like 
        cookies. (Anti-exploitation and Privacy).</dd>
  <dt id="f9">9. Cryptographic future proofing</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers are capable of being updated as technology evolves. Current 
        cryptography techniques are known to be susceptible to quantum computational 
        attacks. Future-proofed identifiers provide a means to continue using the same 
        identifier with updated, advanced authentication and authorization technologies. 
        (Sustainable)</dd>
  <dt id="f10">10. Survives organizational mortality</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers survive the demise of the organization that issued them. They 
        usefulness of these identifiers survive organizations going out of business, 
        being purchased (and potentially losing domain names or root credentials), and 
        even the internal decay of an organization that no longer has the ability to 
        verify the authenticity of records they once issued.</dd>
  <dt id="f11">11. Survives deployment end-of-life</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers are usable even after the systems deployed by relying parties 
        move past their useful lifetime. They are robust against technology fads and can 
        seamlessly work with both legacy and next-generation systems.</dd>
  <dt id="f12">12. Survives relationship with service provider</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers are not dependent on the tenure of the relationship with a 
        service provider. This contrasts with identifiers like service-centric emails, 
        e.g., joe@example.com, which when used as identifiers in other systems can cause 
        problems when individuals no longer use the service provider.</dd>
  <dt id="f13">13. Cryptographic authentication and communication</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers enable cryptographic techniques to authenticate individuals 
        and to secure communications with the subject of the identifier, typically using 
        public-private key pairs.</dd>
  <dt id="f14">14. Service discovery</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers allow relying parties to look up available service endpoints 
        for interacting with the subject of the identifier. (Ease of use and Sustainable)</dd>
  <dt id="f15">15. Registry agnostic</dt>

      <h3>Decentralized Corporate Identifiers (enterprise)</h3>
      <section>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
          There are many types of identifiers that corporations use today
          including tax identification numbers (e.g. 238-42-3893), Legal
          Entity Identifiers (e.g. 5493000IBP32UQZ0KL24), Data Universal
          Numbering System identifiers (aka. DUNS Number) (e.g. 150483782),
          and many more that communicate the unique identity of an organization.
          None of these numbers enable an organization to self-issue an
          identifier or to use the number to cryptographically authenticate or
          digitally sign agreements. A great number of business to business
          and business to customer transactions could be executed more quickly
          and with greater assurance of the validity of the transaction if a
          mechanism to self-issue cryptographic identifiers were created.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="didEnterpriseDescrption">
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
          A North American government would like to ensure that the supply
          chain that feeds electronic products into the country is secure. As
          a result, a new method of submitting digital documentation to Customs
          is enabled that requires that all documentation is provided as
          machine-readable digitally signed data. Digitally signed documentation
          is collected at each stage of the manufacturing, packaging, and
          shipping process. This documentation is then submitted to Customs
          upon the products entry into the country where all digital signatures
          are verified on the documentation. Some aspects of the signed
          documentation, such as firmware hashes and checksums, are then used
          by Customs and downstream customers to verify that the products have
          not been tampered with after leaving the manufacturing facility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Decentralized Identifiers should ensure 1) low
          management overhead for the government, 2) self-management of
          identifiers and cryptographic key material, and 3) a competitive
          marketplace.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="didEnterpriseChallenges">
        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p>
          The requirement of downstream customers to use the same documentation
          and digital signature mechanisms that were provided to Customs is
          potentially problematic in this scenario. Governments often create ad-hoc
          solutions for their import solutions, which make securing the global
          supply chain difficult as each government has their own method of
          securing the supply chain and identifying corporations that downstream
          customers need to integrate with. If you are a global company, that
          means integrating with many supply chain systems (each with different
          capabilities). As such, any securing of the supply chain with downstream
          customers must then depend on the country-specific corporate
          identification and PKI solution, which leads to ad-hoc solutions that
          drive up the cost of doing business across borders.

        <p>
          A supply chain identifier solution that is simple, self-administered,
          built on global standards, is flexible in the cryptographic mechanisms
          used to authenticate, and can be used by governments and downstream
          customers with little to no modification to the regional government

      <h3>Life-long, recipient-managed Credentials (education)</h3>
	    <p class="focalContributor">Contributed by Kim Hamilton-Duffy</p>
      <section id="eduBackground">
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>Educational Verifiable Credentials [[VC-DATA-MODEL]] offer benefits over traditional
          educational credentials in that the recipient is able to store and
          share their credentials, and a third party may independently verify
          the credential (including authenticating the identity of the recipient),
		  without necessarily consulting the issuer, and without dependence on
		  centuries old treaty-based bureaucratic process for the international 
      verification of credentials. This provides the promise of recipient-owned 
		  long-lived credentials that the recipient may use in any country, 
		  even if the issuing institution goes out of business.
        </p>
        <p> However, traditional public-private key pair-based identifiers 
			present challenges for rotating keys, especially if 
			the identifier in a credential is simply the public key (with 
			the private key used for authentication).</p>
        <ol>
    		<li>With the public key embedded in the digitally signed credential, 
				it is literally impossible to update the signing key; a recipient 
				must  contact the issuer and request re-issuing with a new 
				identifer. If the issuer is not reachable, or is unwilling 
				or unable to issue a new credential, the recipient cannot 
				update the cryptographic material.</li>
			<li>If the credential relies on a centralized key registry or 
				authority for managing rotation, then that registry becomes 
				the centralized point of failure. This may or may not be an 
				improvement, especially for longer held credentials.</li>
			<li>If the credential's cryptographic technology becomes outdated, 
				there is no way to update the credential to use a more robust 
				technology; a recipient must contact the issuer for reissuance.</li>
		  </ol>
        <p>The key rotation is particularly problematic for credentials 
            expected to last a lifetime. It should be anticipated that 
			a given individual will change their key management strategy and 
		    systems several times over the course of their life, e.g. relying
		    on a cloud wallet, a mobile wallet, or a dedicated hardware wallet,
		    as their needs change.</p>
        <p>By issuing an educational credential to a recipient's DID, the 
			recipient has the ability to prove ownership of a credential even 
			if the cryptographic material used for authenticating changes over time.

			to authenticate, using her current hardware wallet (with rotated keys). 
			In addition to the fact that her name matches the name on the diploma, 
			the cryptographic authentication provides a robust verification of her

          Alicia wants help with her urinary tract infection (UTI) and is a bit

        <p>
          Alicia is in a state that allows an online service to diagnose and 
          prescribe medication. She uses the identity wallet on her smartphone
          to register with the online medical practice. She tells the online 
          practice her name is Althea (a pseudonym)
          with password-less authentication and a verified driver's license
          credential to prove that she's a resident of the state. The remote physician,
          Barkley, is licensed by the state Board of Medicine and credentialed by the
          online service. He's securely signed in using the
          identity wallet on his smartphone. Barkley issues Alicia a digital
          prescription in the form of a verifiable credential and allows Alicia
          to download it however she pleases. Alicia is a librarian and trusts
          her local public library to erase their logs as allowed by law. She
          uses one of their computers to sign-in and do all of this. She snaps
          a picture of the QR code that is the prescription to take to the
          pharmacy. Connor, the licensed pharmacist, scans the prescription
          QR code and fills the prescription. Alicia pays cash.

          with Alicia. Alicia can be anonymous or pairwise-pseudonymous with both
          Barkley and Connor and everything just works. Alicia, Barkley, and Connor          
          all keep separate and legally authentic copies of the records of their
          interaction in case of dispute.

          privacy engineering as we shift to convenient and cost-effective
          online commerce among licensed and unlicensed individuals as peers.
          Barkley and Connor benefit by reducing or even eliminating the influence
          of their respective institutions or employers and therefore make more
          money. They pass some savings to Alicia who also gets increased peace

      <h3>Digital Executor (law)</h3>
      <section id="lawBackground">
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
          Today, when people die, there are no standard technologies for heirs,
          executors, or probate courts to properly take control of an individual's
          online accounts and digital assets. With a DID linked to accounts and
          assets, a DID owner could define a trigger for a third party to assume
          control over the DID Document. Ideally, this trigger would specify (a)
          an oracle (how to know the death/incapacity occurred), (b) a means for
          the new owner to assert control, and (c) appropriate checks and
          accountability.

        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
          Kathy uses DIDs to manage her authentications to various services.
          As part of her estate planning, she generates a unique credential
          that she gives to her attorney, Gloria, with provisions specified in
          her will, which initially lists Mike as the digital executor. With
          appropriate obfuscation, that credential is specified in multiple DID
          documents as a probate authority, with the authorization to change the
          master key in case of death, which shall be recorded publicly, on chain,
          as a notarized invocation of the probate authority. As it happens,
          Kathy had a falling out with Mike and notified Gloria just two weeks
          before her death that her friend Miyake should now be her digital
          executor. Upon Kathy's death, Gloria uses the probate credential to
          publicly record the assertion of probate and to replace the DID's master
          key with a new key, controlled by Miyake, who lives in Japan (Kathy,
          Gloria, and Mike live in the United States). Now, any system using
          Kathy's DIDs for authentication can programmatically recognized Miyake's
          authority <em>and</em> specifically know that Kathy's credentials were
          modified under a assertion of probate.

      <section id="lawChallenges">
        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p>
          The late date change in digital executorship from Mike to Miyake
          could be problematic if Kathy had directly listed Mike's credential
          in the DID Document. Because she instead chose to rely on her attorney,
          Kathy has a more flexible way to direct her wishes, while still
          leveraging the collective control over her authenticated logins to
          various services. In addition, Miyake's geographic location could
          make it hard for them to travel to the United States and may make it
          difficult to provide proof of identity traditionally used by U.S. courts.
          Also, because Gloria invokes the probate mechanism, Miyake need only
          provide a suitable credential at that time; he did not need to create
          and maintain a credential over a long period of time (as would be the
          case if Gloria weren't involved).
