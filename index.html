      <p>This document sets out use cases and requirements for a new type of identifier that has 4 essential characteristics:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>decentralized</strong>: there should be no central issuing
        agency;</li>
        <li><strong>persistent</strong>: the identifier should be inherently
        persistent, not requiring the continued operation of an underling organization;</li>

        <li><strong>resolvable</strong>: it should be possible to discover
        metadata about the identifier.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Although existing identifiers may display some of these characteristics, none currently displays all four.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="sotd"></section>
    <section id="intro">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The need for globally unique identifier schemes has been addressed many
      times. Globally unique ID schemes typically rely on a central authority
      controlling a 'root' space that is then delegated to local organizations
      who in turn delegate to further organizations who eventually add the final
      string to complete the identifier. Even if we restrict ourselves to online
      identifiers, there are many examples of this.</p><ul>
  <li>IANA controls the root namespace of the Internet's Domain Name System;
      registrars operate the top level domains and then license specific domain
      names to their clients, and it's these clients who create the actual
      identifiers for online resources (URLs). The example below shows who
      controls what in a typical URL.

<pre class="example">

                IANA
                 ↓
https://example.com/page.html
           ↑           ↑
        Registrar   Licensee
</pre></li>
  <li><abbr title="Digital Object Identifier">DOI</abbr>s have the form
    <code>10.{registrant}/{suffix}</code> where 'registrant' is defined by the
    DOI organization and the suffix by the registrant.</li>
  <li>Global Trade Item Numbers (GTINs) seen on many of the world's barcodes
      are managed in a similar way, as are Legal Entity Identifiers,
      <abbr title="International Standard Book Number">ISBN</abbr>s and more.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In all these cases, ultimately, there is a central authority on which the
   identifier system depends. Those central authorities go to significant
    efforts to make their identifiers persistent and resolvable, however,
    should they cease to exist, the long term integrity of the identifier
    is at least questionable to a greater or lesser extent. For as long as
    those organizations exist (and they are generally well established with no
    immediate threat to their survival), the way to assess whether a particular
    identifier is in some way 'valid' is to query the issuing authority.</p>
  <p>These factors point to a need in some circumstances for a globally unique
    identifier that is 'self sovereign', that is, one that does not depend on
    any issuing authority. Universally unique identifiers (<a>UUID</a>s) [[RFC4122]]
    fulfill this role, however, there is no way to <em>prove</em> control of
    a <abbr title="Universally unique identifier">UUID</abbr>.</p>
  <p>This document sets out use cases and requirements for a new kind of
    identifier that meets all these basic requirements:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>decentralized</strong>: there should be no central issuing
        agency;</li>
        <li><strong>persistent</strong>: the identifier should be inherently
        persistent, not requiring the continued operation of an underling organization;</li>
        <li><strong>cryptographically verifiable</strong>: it should be possible
        to prove control of the identifier cryptographically;</li>
        <li><strong>resolvable</strong>: it should be possible to discover
        metadata about the identifier.</li>
    </ol>

  <section id="existingWork">
    <h3>Existing Work</h3>
    <p>The use cases and requirements set out below have not been created <i>a
        priori</i>. Substantial work has been done within W3C and elsewhere
        leading, in particular, to <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/08/did-20190828/">Decentralized
        Identifiers (DIDs) Data Model and Syntaxes</a> published as a Community
        Group Report by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">Credentials
        Community Group</a> in August 2019. That work provides a framework &mdash;
        a set of concepts &mdash; that have proved to be useful when discussing
        <abbr title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>s and the problems they
        can solve (see below). Those concepts are used within this document to
        set out the detail of the problem that the Decentralized Identifier Working
        Group is <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/09/did-wg-charter">chartered</a>
        to solve. It is the nature of the standardization process that these
        terms may be modified within the standard itself and therefore, their
        use here should not be seen as authoritative.</p>
      </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id="concepts">Concepts of Decentralized Identity</h2>
	<!-- <p class="issue" data-number="39">Terminology in this opening prose is being discussed, in particular
	the term 'relying party' which has been changed to 'requesting party' in this version of the doc.</p> -->
        <p>A decentralized system will enable several key actions by three
		distinct entities: the Controller, the Requesting Party, and the Subject.</p>
        <p>Controllers create and control <abbr title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>s,
		while Requesting Parties rely on <abbr title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>s
          as an identifier for  interactions related to the <a>DID Subject</a>.</p>
        <p>The Subject is the entity referred to by the <abbr title="Decentralized
          Identifier">DID</abbr>, which can be anything: a person,  an organization,
          a device, a location, even a concept. Typically, the Subject is also
          the Controller, but in cases of guardianship, agents (human or software),
          and inanimate Subjects, this is not possible. As such, the Subject has
		no functional  role. When the Subject is, in fact, the <a>DID Controller</a>, we
          consider the action to  be taken by the Controller on their own behalf
          as the Subject. When the Subject  is not the DID Controller, the Controller
          is said to be taking action on behalf of the Subject, such as when an
          employee manages a <abbr title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>
          on behalf of their employer  or a parent uses a <abbr title="Decentralized
          Identifier">DID</abbr> on behalf of their child.</p>
	    <p>The DID Controller and Requesting Party may be individuals or interactive
          systems, but for simplicity in this document, we refer to both as if
          they were individual  persons performing these actions. </p>
	  <p>Only a <a>DID Controller</a> can perform the actions that control a <abbr
          title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>, however, anyone can act
	  as a Requesting Party for any <abbr title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>
          they know, including the DID Controller, should they wish to inspect or
          verify their own <abbr title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>.</p>
        <p>This use case document defines these actions in terms of the eventual
          systems we anticipate using the resultant specification.</p>

        <p>Perhaps the most salient point about <a>Decentralized Identifiers</a> is
        that there are no "Identity Providers". Instead, this role is subsumed
        in the decentralized systems that Controllers use to manage <abbr
        title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>s and, in turn, Requesting
		Parties use to apply <abbr title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>s.
        These  decentralized systems, which we refer to as <abbr
        title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr> registries, are designed to
        operate independently from any particular service provider and hence,
        free from  any given platform authority. It is anticipated that <abbr
        title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>s will be registered using
        distributed ledger technology (<a>DLT</a>).

        <p>In practice, the definition and operation of all current decentralized
        systems retain some elements of centralized control. Depending on the
        criteria one uses to evaluate such systems &mdash; from who controls
        the most widely used code base to who controls  the specification &mdash;
        where a system resides on the spectrum of centralized and decentralized
        varies. However, the design of any decentralized identity system is
        separate from the  academic debate about how decentralized it may be
        in practice.</p>
        <p>The use cases presented below make use of a number of high level
        concepts as follows.</p>

<div class="note" title="Shared terminology">
  <p>This section uses a snapshot of the terminology 
	  section of the DID Core specification, as published in the 
	  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2020/WD-did-core-20201108/#terminology">8 November

For example, a parent who controls a child's <a>DID document</a> might permit
the child to use their personal device in order to <a>authenticate</a>. In
this case, the child is the <a>DID delegate</a>. The child's personal device
would contain the private cryptographic material enabling the child to

A set of data describing the <a>DID subject</a>, including mechanisms, such as
public keys and pseudonymous biometrics, that the <a>DID subject</a> or a
<a>DID delegate</a> can use to <a>authenticate</a> itself and prove its
association with the <a>DID</a>. A DID document may also contain other
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_(computing)">attributes</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claims-based_identity">claims</a>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="DID paths|DID path" data-plurals="did paths" id="dfn-did-paths">DID path</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
The portion of a <a>DID URL</a> that begins with and includes the first forward

  <dd>
The function that takes as its input a <a>DID</a> and a set of input
metadata and returns a <a>DID document</a> in a conforming <a>representation</a>
plus additional metadata. This function relies on the "Read" operation of the
applicable <a>DID method</a>.

  <dt><dfn data-lt="DID URLs|DID URL" data-plurals="did urls" id="dfn-did-urls">DID URL</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
A <a>DID</a> plus any additional syntactic component that conforms to  the
definition of the DID URL Syntax [[DID-CORE]]. This includes an optional <a>DID
path</a> (with its leading <code>/</code> character), optional <a>DID query</a>
(with its leading <code>?</code> character), and optional <a>DID fragment</a>
(with its leading <code>#</code> character).
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn id="dfn-did-url-dereferencing">DID URL dereferencing</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
The function that takes as its input a <a>DID URL</a>, a <a>DID document</a>,
plus a set of dereferencing options, and returns a <a>resource</a>. This
resource may be a <a>DID document</a> plus additional metadata, or it may be a
secondary resource contained within the <a>DID document</a>, or it may be a
resource entirely external to the <a>DID document</a>. If the function begins
with a <a>DID URL</a>, it uses the <a>DID resolution</a> function to fetch a
<a>DID document</a> indicated by the <a>DID</a> contained within the
<a>DID URL</a>. The dereferencing function then can perform additional
processing on the <a>DID document</a> to return the dereferenced resource
indicated by the <a>DID URL</a>.

		able to provide identity documentation in the form of signed statements of title transfer from each of the owners,
		all the way back to the original, which includes a statement of authenticity from the original manufacturer. Each of
		the signed statements can be independently verified because they were signed using public DIDs for the buyer and seller.
		The collected signatures comprise a complete chain of custody along with some interesting anecdotes about each sale.
		Merry was able to verify the provenance of the card and delighted Eli with a surprise gift of a perfect replacement for his lost memento.</p>

			fuel purchases and saved telemetry reports to storage, where it was kept securely under her control.</p>
		<p>She found an insurance company that was able to automatically offer her a discount after passing a certification

          <h3>Cross-platform User-driven Sharing</h3>
		<p>Franklyn is frustrated by the seemingly endless surveillance that tracks his activity online. He is a
			single father of two girls whose privacy is absolutely vital to him. He does what he can to minimize
			the ways in which he might accidentally put his kids at risk, avoiding sharing details of his life,
			his shopping, or the inadvertent geo-located digital photo. He has minimized his digital footprint and
			opted out of everything but the most secure and privacy respecting sites.</p>
		<p>However, when he can verify that a website is meeting his own standards for privacy and is willing to accept
			a fiduciary obligation to protect his information, he appreciates the personalized services
			that can be created by sharing select nuggets of information while remaining as anonymous as possible.</p>
		<p>For each service, he creates a new unique DID and authorizes the company to use it to track him, as long as they
			have agreed to his specific terms of service, which covers inappropriate use of his data, whether internally
			or in redistributing it to other companies. With this unique identifier, the services are able to build
			up a history of interactions with Franklyn, without recourse to his legal identity, IP address, any
			credit or income data, nothing. Just the DID. By authenticating, using the DID, the service has an exceptionally
			strong assurance that the current session user is Franklyn. Should the store data become compromised in a data breach,
			all the attackers will get is a history of shopping and shopping lists associated with an arbitrary DID
			controlled by an unknown party.</p>
		<p>As he becomes comfortable with a given service, he gradually shares more details, such as his pending shopping requirements.
			This virtual shopping list is broken into categories and different parts are shared with different retailers depending
			on their specialty. The stores are able to notify Franklyn of any special offers, which he is free to ignore or
			take advantage of.</p>
		<p>Thanks to a promotional banner at a particular retailer's website, Franklyn learned he could get an extra discount on
			clothing because he is a military veteran. He gives that retailer a digital credential attesting to his status and
			links it to the DID they already have, securing the military discount for the rest of his relationship with them.</p>
		<p>Both Franklyn and the merchant realize that, over time, the merchant will have an increasingly accurate profile of
		Franklyn's interests and this might prompt him to begin using a new DID, unlinked to the previous one. Recognizing this
			as a negative in some of their customers' opinions, the merchant explicitly offers Franklyn the option of revoking his current DID.
			Doing so would mean that access to, and use of, the information associated with the DID would be restricted to
			legal record-keeping mandates clearly described in the merchant's privacy policy.</p>
			<p>Even without this explicit option, as Franklyn is the controller of the DID, he can cancel access to his data storage or simply
			revoke the DID entirely at any time.</p>

  <section id="supplyChain"><h3>Pseudonymity within a supply chain</h3>
	<p>Modern supply chains are highly complex, typically involving multiple companies taking ownership and/or custody of shipments from the point of
	origin through to the final destination, be that a retailer or end consumer. Furthermore, since most mass-produced products are made to stock rather than
	bespoke for a specific customer, the manufacturer typically does not know which final  retailer or retail store will receive each specific product instance;
	the individual path through the supply chain network is not predefined by the manufacturer but instead emerges over time as a set of intermediate distributors
	and wholesalers distribute product in response to orders from their customers. Data concerning that supply chain can be commercially sensitive. For example,
	a transport company may not wish their customer to know that they sub contracted part of the journey to another partner. It can be a security risk too. The
	locations of warehouses and distribution centers where large stocks of particular items are held can be a target for the insertion of counterfeit goods into
	legitimate supplies.</p>
	<p>A downstream party such as a retailer, pharmacy or end consumer may have a legitimate reason or in some cases a legal requirement to know that
	each product is genuine and can be traced back to the genuine manufacturer through an unbroken chain of custody, without any gaps or inconsistencies
	in the traceability data.</p>
	<p>A downstream party may also want to check whether the product ID and serial number were actually issued by the manufacturer. However, the manufacturer may
	not want to provide such information about valid serial numbers to its competitors or counterfeiters, so there may be a need to control access to such services.</p>
	<p>For these reasons and more, identifiers for business partners, locations and transactions often need to be obfuscated, and the data exchanged between
	partners is typically restricted both in terms of its content and in terms of access to it. This is especially true when a manufacturer does not want its
	competitors to know the actual source of the ingredients or components in its products. Different parties will be interested in different things too. For
	example, a retailer may be interested in knowing where a particular shipment is and when it is expected to arrive; a consumer of a food product is more likely
	to be concerned about the original source of the item and the total number of food miles in the product.</p>
	<p>Decentralized Identifiers could be generated by sending and receiving parties at each stage in the chain. This would preserve pseudonymity yet prove control
	of the identified shipment at each stage and, via the DID Document, provide access to data (subject to authorization) pertaining to each transaction without
	enabling correlation across multiple shipments or other sensitive information.</p>

      <h3>Importing retro toys</h3>
      <p>Jodie is operations manager at ImportersRUs, a boutique importer
        specializing in small run retro products manufactured in Asia.
        Last year she got her big break when she licensed the right to make "Retro"
        Lima Bean Babies, a huge collector phenomenon in the 1990s. As long as her
        products have a distinct, visible tag with "R" on one side and "Retro" on
        the other, she can manufacture anything from the Lima Bean Babies catalog.</p>
      <p>
        To handle fulfilment, Jodie works in small batches
        with a large number of different products and
        frequently changes manufacturers to stay on top of shifting materials,
        transportation, and tariff costs.</p>
      <p>Jodie registers a DID with US Customs and Border Protection (US CBP) for
        ImportersRUs (demonstrating proof-of-control as she does) and secures a digital
        license from Tie Enterprises (owners of the Lima Bean Babies trademark and designs)
        issued to her DID and signed using a DID that Tie Enterprises has also
        registered with US CBP.
        For her manufacturers, Jodie cryptographically delegates the digital license to
        individual manufacturers using the DID (which is both the subject of the license
        <em>and</em> known to US CBP). Those manufacturers are responsible for getting
        the product to the port of Los Angeles. They, in turn, cryptographically delegate
        their licenses to logistics firms to actually move the product from their facility
        to Los Angeles, while maintaining cryptographic verifiability of both the
        original license, and the chain of delegations.</p>
      <p>When her products reach the United States, US CBP can automatically review the
        digital manifest filed for entry and each of the delegations to verify that this given
        batch of products is, in fact, officially licensed Lima Bean Baby products.
      </p>
      <p>This digitally verifiable provenance of
        her license streamlines access through US Customs, regardless of her supply
        chain, without reducing the effectiveness of US CBP at fighting the illegal
        import of pirated product.</p>

          <h3>Correlation-controlled Services</h3>
        <p>Cary is frustrated by the seemingly ubiquitous systems of privatized surveillance that monitor her actions in an
     attempt to improve their convenience. She was one the first adopters of anti-cookie features and anti-adware software 
     and avoids "Sign-in with (some platform)". Unfortunately, this also means that she doesn't get the benefits offered by 
     many of today's online services including the ability to cut the airport security line or shop by using her face at the 
	      neighborhood market. She just isn't willing to sacrifice her privacy by using OAuth or OpenID Connect for a 
		convenient login: every sign-in with those technologies is visible to the "identity provider". Further, behind 
		the scenes, every service is legally able to correlate the identifier she uses for authentication with each other, 
		collecting information that Cary may not have divulged if asked directly. She finds it manipulative at best, and 
		at times, outright coercive. With Decentralized Identifiers, Cary creates a pair-wise unique DID for every service 
		provider she interacts with, and her wallet and/or agent not only manages which DID is used for which service, it
		also manages &mdash; if she approves it directly or though policy &mdash; automatic authentication and authorization 
		with those services she trusts. She now has cryptographically unique identifiers that are correlatable only by 
		those services she chooses to use them &mdash; and a single-sign-on experience with her semi-autonomous client-side 
		self-sovereign or fiduciary delegate &mdash; without introducing a third party who knows every site she visits.</p>

        <p>Controllers create DIDs, uniquely binding cryptographic proofs with the identifier, typically using

		it may be explicitly constructed as a  stand-alone resource and either stored or referenced in the registry.
		In this scenario, the process will need access to any registry, ideally a decentralized system, and like the
		rest of the DID actions, it should be possible to create the DID without interaction with any particular authority.</p>

		that DIDs be human readable. Thus they may contain long, complex numbers represented in  various formats. For
		ease of use, implementations may rely on data carriers such as QR codes [[QR]] for ease of capture using a camera-enabled device

		(forming a <a>DID URL</a>), dereferencing will return the resource pointed to from the named service endpoint, which was
		discovered by resolving the DID to its DID Document and looking up the endpoint by name. In this way, a

      <section>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
          There are many types of identifiers that corporations use today
          including tax identification numbers (e.g. 238-42-3893), Legal
          Entity Identifiers (e.g. 5493000IBP32UQZ0KL24), Data Universal
          Numbering System identifiers (a.k.a. DUNS Number, e.g. 150483782),
	  Global Location Number (e.g. 9501101020016),
          and many more that communicate the unique identity of an organization.
          None of these numbers enable an organization to self-issue an
          identifier or to use the number to cryptographically authenticate or
          digitally sign agreements. Business to business
          and business to customer transactions might be conducted with more
	  efficiency and with greater assurance of the validity of the
	  transaction if a mechanism to self-issue cryptographic identifiers
	  were created.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="didEnterpriseDescrption">
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
          A North American government would like to ensure that the supply
          chain that feeds electronic products into the country is secure. As
          a result, a new method of submitting digital documentation to Customs is enabled that requires that all documentation is
	  provided as machine-readable digitally signed data with proof of provenance from supply chain partners whose identities
	  are themselves known to a high degree of certainty. Digitally signed documentation
          is collected at each stage of the manufacturing, packaging, and
          shipping process. This documentation is then submitted to Customs
          upon the product's entry into the country where all digital signatures
          are verified on the documentation. Some aspects of the signed
          documentation, such as firmware hashes and checksums, are then used
          by Customs and downstream customers to verify that the products have
          not been tampered with after leaving the manufacturing facility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Decentralized Identifiers should ensure 1) low
          management overhead for the government, 2) self-management of
          identifiers and cryptographic key material, and 3) a competitive
          marketplace.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="didEnterpriseChallenges">
        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p>
          The requirement of downstream customers to use the same documentation
          and digital signature mechanisms that were provided to Customs is
          potentially problematic in this scenario. Governments often create ad-hoc
          solutions for their import solutions, which make securing the global
          supply chain difficult as each government has their own method of
          securing the supply chain and identifying corporations that downstream
          customers need to integrate with. If you are a global company, that
          means integrating with many supply chain systems (each with different
          capabilities). As such, any securing of the supply chain with downstream
          customers must then depend on the country-specific corporate
          identification and PKI solution, which leads to ad-hoc solutions that
          drive up the cost of doing business across borders.
        </p>
        <p>
          A supply chain identifier solution that is simple, self-administered,
          built on global standards, is flexible in the cryptographic mechanisms
          used to authenticate, and can be used by governments and downstream
          customers with little to no modification to the regional government
          or corporate systems does not exist today.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="didEnterpriseDistinctions">
        <h4>Distinctions</h4>
        <p>
          Many Decentralized Identifier use cases focus on Self-Sovereign
          Identity and individuals. This use case focuses on organizations and
          their departments as entities that would also benefit from

      <h3>Life-long Credentials (education)</h3>
	    <p class="focalContributor">Contributed by Kim Hamilton-Duffy</p>
      <section id="eduBackground">
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>Educational Verifiable Credentials [[VC-DATA-MODEL]] offer benefits over traditional
          educational credentials in that the recipient is able to store and
          share their credentials, and a third party may independently verify
          the credential (including authenticating the identity of the recipient),
		  without necessarily consulting the issuer, and without dependence on
		  centuries old treaty-based bureaucratic process for the international
      verification of credentials. This provides the promise of recipient-owned
		  long-lived credentials that the recipient may use in any country,
		  even if the issuing institution goes out of business.
        </p>
        <p> However, traditional public-private key pair-based identifiers
			present challenges for rotating keys, especially if
			the identifier in a credential is simply the public key (with
			the private key used for authentication).</p>
        <ol>
    		<li>With the public key embedded in the digitally signed credential,
				it is literally impossible to update the signing key; a recipient
				must  contact the issuer and request re-issuing with a new
				identifier. If the issuer is not reachable, or is unwilling
				or unable to issue a new credential, the recipient cannot
				update the cryptographic material.</li>
			<li>If the credential relies on a centralized key registry or
				authority for managing rotation, then that registry becomes
				the centralized point of failure. This may or may not be an
				improvement, especially for longer held credentials.</li>
			<li>If the credential's cryptographic technology becomes outdated,
				there is no way to update the credential to use a more robust
				technology; a recipient must contact the issuer for reissuance.</li>
		  </ol>
        <p>The key rotation is particularly problematic for credentials
            expected to last a lifetime. It should be anticipated that
			a given individual will change their key management strategy and
		    systems several times over the course of their life, e.g. relying
		    on a cloud wallet, a mobile wallet, or a dedicated hardware wallet,
		    as their needs change.</p>
        <p>By issuing an educational credential to a recipient's DID, the
			recipient has the ability to prove ownership of a credential even
			if the cryptographic material used for authenticating changes over time.</p>

			In addition to the fact that her name matches the name on the diploma,

      <section id="lawBackground">
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
          Today, when people die, there are no standard technologies for heirs,
          executors, or probate courts to properly take control of an individual's
          online accounts and digital assets. With a DID linked to accounts and
          assets, a DID owner could define a trigger for a third party to assume
          control over the DID Document. Ideally, this trigger would specify (a)
          an oracle (how to know the death/incapacity occurred), (b) a means for
          the new owner to assert control, and (c) appropriate checks and
          accountability.

        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
          Kathy uses DIDs to manage her authentications to various services.
          As part of her estate planning, she generates a unique credential
          that she gives to her attorney, Gloria, with provisions specified in
          her will, which initially lists Mike as the digital executor. With
          appropriate obfuscation, that credential is specified in multiple DID
          documents as a probate authority, with the authorization to change the
          master key in case of death, which shall be recorded publicly, on chain,
          as a notarized invocation of the probate authority. As it happens,
          Kathy had a falling out with Mike and notified Gloria just two weeks
          before her death that her friend Miyake should now be her digital
          executor. Upon Kathy's death, Gloria uses the probate credential to
          publicly record the assertion of probate and to replace the DID's master
          key with a new key, controlled by Miyake, who lives in Japan (Kathy,
          Gloria, and Mike live in the United States). Now, any system using
          Kathy's DIDs for authentication can programmatically recognized Miyake's
          authority <em>and</em> specifically know that Kathy's credentials were
          modified under a assertion of probate.

      <section id="lawChallenges">
        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p>
          The late date change in digital executorship from Mike to Miyake
          could be problematic if Kathy had directly listed Mike's credential
          in the DID Document. Because she instead chose to rely on her attorney,
          Kathy has a more flexible way to direct her wishes, while still
          leveraging the collective control over her authenticated logins to
          various services. In addition, Miyake's geographic location could
          make it hard for them to travel to the United States and may make it
          difficult to provide proof of identity traditionally used by U.S. courts.
          Also, because Gloria invokes the probate mechanism, Miyake need only
          provide a suitable credential at that time; he did not need to create
          and maintain a credential over a long period of time (as would be the
          case if Gloria weren't involved).

<h3>Alice Rents a Car (credentials)</h3>

<section id="aliceRentsBackground">
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>It’s 2021 and <abbr title="Self-Sovereign Identity">SSI</abbr> is the golden child. Alice looks forward to never having to
	use a password or fill out a form again. Alice’s service providers are looking to adopt zero-trust architecture with
	<abbr title="Year 2000 bug">Y2K</abbr> zeal. Neither of them really know what SSI or zero-trust means, but they want it.</p>
</section>
<section id="aliceRentsDescription"><h4>Description</h4>
<p>Alice has just provisioned an “agent” as recommended by an organization she trusts and supported by her browser vendor.
	It’s costing her $5/month and is somehow linked to the facial recognition that also unlocks her smartphone. Her
	agent occasionally sends a text message asking a question with a yes or no answer but otherwise mostly leaves her
	alone. Her agent bears a “Magic Button” logo that she thinks is a bit like “credit cards welcome here” in the old days.</p>
<p>Alice is going to France. She uses a non-tracking search engine to discover a list of car rental companies anonymously to avoid
	price discrimination and targeted ads. Some of the rental companies display the "Magic Button" logo, some don’t. She
	knows that the ones that do will respect her agent. She picks a company for the rental even though she has never done
	business with them before, knowing that with "Magic Button" her user experience will be an automated breeze.</p>
<p>Among dozens of others, Alice already has "Magic Button" service providers for her US driver’s license, her US insurance,
	and her bank. The <abbr title="Department of Motor Vehicles.">DMV</abbr>, insurer, and bank all authenticate Alice using
	a secure pseudonym linked to her smartphone. Each of the three has a different DID for Alice, but each of the three knows
	that they can use that DID in court to hold Alice accountable. Alice just knows that her smartphone allowed her to sign her
	driver’s license application, her insurance application, and her bank customer registration form using facial recognition because "Magic Button" works.</p>
<p>Alice clicks on the “Rent Now” button and:</p><ul>
  <li>Exposes a DID through her agent in order to set up a secure communication channel.</li>
  <li>The car rental company tells Alice’s agent that they will need license, insurance, and bank info for the purpose of
	  renting a car in France.</li>
  <li>Alice’s agent has a policy that saying that any company as large as her chosen car rental company can get whatever
	  they explicitly ask for. Smaller companies, or large ones on a blacklist may need Alice to give explicit permission
	  &mdash; which the agent will ask for using a text message.</li>
  <li>Alice’s agent offers three signed bearer tokens authorizing release of her personal information from three specific
	  service providers. These tokens are encrypted so that the rental company doesn’t know what’s in them. Alice’s service
	  providers use pre-registered information linked to their DID for Alice to decrypt the tokens and verify they were signed by Alice’s agent.</li>
  <li>Note, that in this example, Alice does not care that her three service providers know she is becoming a rental customer.
	  If Alice did care, she might go through the trouble of having one or another of the services issue a Verified Credential
	  to her so she can present it wherever she wants. Alice’s agent has policies that force the more privacy preserving,
	  Holder-mediated flow when dealing with some less trusted vendors.</li>
  <li>The rental company gathers the information from Alice’s service providers, checks it against their internal rental policies,
	  and issues Alice’s agent a signed capability linked to a QR code. The agent emails the capability to Alice.</li></ul>
<p>The whole sequence from click in the search results to Alice getting a QR code in the email took 8 seconds. A week later:</p><ul>
  <li>Alice goes to the rental garage at Charles de Gaulle airport, and picks a car with the keys already in it and the price posted on
	  the parking space. She drives to the automated exit gate.</li>
  <li>At the gate, Alice opens her email, shows the QR code she received through her agent and gets a message on her phone
	  asking her to scan her face. The gate agent combines the license info of the car, the QR code and the challenge signed
	  by Alice with her face and opens the gate.</li></ul>
</section>
<section id="aliceRentsChallenges"><h4>Challenges</h4>
<p>The challenge in this case is to combine technical standards and protocols into a <em>human-meaningful</em> interoperability
	claim that crosses between one's general-purpose agent and a multitude of domain-specific service offerings.</p>
</section>
<section id="aliceRentsDistinction"><h4>Distinction</h4>
<p>This use case is based on a profiling exercise by a group to be determined and the voluntary adoption of the badge by some
	agents and some service providers. The badge need not be associated with a costly certification process which means that
	both audited and un-audited versions of the claim can co-exist. False and misleading assertions are already enforced by

      <h3>Portable Secure Communication</h3>
		    	    <p class="focalContributor">Contributed by Nader Helmy, Daniel Hardman, Ted Thibodeau Jr</p>

      <section id="messagingBackground">
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
Designing systems that securely support the scale of global communication
on the Web has traditionally come with a distinct set of tradeoffs that
often negatively impact end-users. Current <abbr title="Public Key
Infrastructure">PKI</abbr> systems tightly control who gets to manage
and control the cryptographic keys associated with the set of digital
certificates that serve as the backbone of the internet. This constraint
means that modern cryptography is largely unusable for the average user,
forcing them to borrow or "rent" identifiers such as email addresses,
usernames, and website domains, through systems like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509">X.509</a>, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network">social
networks</a>. By not directly controlling their own identifiers, people
who want to use secure communication are not only unable to utilize
cryptographic security in many of their everyday interactions, they are
also limited to choosing between traditional secure messaging services
to safely communicate with friends and family in a limited, chat-style
context.
        </p>
        <p>
In a traditional secure messaging approach, the security is a property 
of the platform; if a user changes platforms, either temporarily or 
permanently, they get their security a different way, tied to a different 
login and different terms of service. DIDs take security out of the hands 
of the context owner, i.e., an application or service provider, and put 
it in the hands of the DID controller, who can choose the contexts in 
which they want to communicate and when. This makes security decentralized 
and portable, instead of having the security of an interaction tied to the 
protocol, transport, or application used to facilitate it. This feature 
allows people to easily switch communication contexts without losing any 
security guarantees, and provides a resilient backbone for all internet 
communications. Moving away from traditional identifiers, such as phone 
numbers and email addresses, can help to break down the siloed ecosystems 
that prevent data portability and make it difficult to more broadly 
incorporate secure communication technology in applications and services. 
Current approaches to secure communication often have drawbacks such as 
the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
reliance on commonly used identifiers which are not directly under 
user control
          </li>
          <li>
use of a central intermediary or centralized components to facilitate 
interactions
          </li>
          <li>
requirement that one or more parties have a highly available web server
          </li>
          <li>
siloed and non-interoperable security architectures tied to a single 
domain
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
DIDs help to solve this issue by enabling a style of communication which
is truly peer-to-peer and message-based. Message-based systems decouple
the relationship between producers of messages and consumers of messages,
creating an abstraction that puts the two on equal footing and allows for
many different kinds of devices with differing requirements to interface
in a flexible and technology-neutral way. DIDs allow people to
simultaneously use the same identifier for both traditional communications
and newer transactions that require a higher level of cryptographic
security, as well as allowing them to switch contexts without losing any
security guarantees. These decentralized identifiers are not rented or
borrowed from centralized providers but are instead directly under user
control.

        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
Samira is a humanitarian aid worker in Khartoum who wants to create connections with new people she meets. 
		She has a smartphone but doesn’t always have Internet access in the remote areas that she 
		visits in her line of work. Since she can’t always use the Internet, most of her preferred 
		methods of communication are not always available. When she’s offline and meets a new person 
		she wishes to communicate with, she establishes a direct secure connection between her device 
		and theirs by having them scan a QR code to pass on her DID and start sharing peer-to-peer 
		messages secured by the keys on her device. When online, Samira’s DID can be resolved to its 
		DID document that contains her public key material. In this way, she can maintain these secure 
		connections whether she has access to the Internet or not. Whenever Samira is working on a new 
		campaign or wants to raise awareness about issues affecting her local region, she is able to 
		securely communicate with all relevant parties, regardless of the device, platform, or network 
		infrastructure they are using. </p>
<p>At one point, Samira sees a friend of hers, Ahmed, who’s part of a local organization campaigning against 
	unfair labor practices in local agriculture. Samira wants to support the efforts of this group and get 
	involved, but she worries that publicly allying with the farm workers will negatively affect her ability 
	to act as a neutral party in labor negotiations. By creating a unique DID for herself in the group at very 
	little cost, she can engage in online multi-party secure communication with all of the members of Ahmed’s 
	organization. Messages are secured via mutual authentication between Samira and each of the other members. 
	Using these connections, and using either direct peer to peer connections or online services that both Samira
	and Ahmed trust not to have any ‘backdoors’,  they are able to have private and confidential communications 
	with the other members at any time, without fear of censorship. Members of the organization are able to have 
	confidence that they’re talking to Samira, and she can verify who she is communicating with. Samira can use 
	the same identifier and connection with the group to share credentials that prove she’s a humanitarian worker 
	and attest to her history.</p>
<p>Eventually, Samira loses her phone. To make sure no one impersonates her, she revokes the keys on all of the DIDs 
	she is using for communication. Rather than losing access to all of her existing connections, Samira is able 
	to update her online service endpoints and routing capabilities to make sure she continues to receive messages 
	securely on the devices she still owns. When she gets a new phone, she can add new keys to her DID Document to 
	continue exchanging secure messages online with her connections without interruption. Keys shared through direct, 
	offline connections need to be updated individually by Samira to ensure continued communication. Should Samira want to change the DIDs she’s using (for instance, 
	because she’s changing DID method providers), she can send a message to her connections notifying them that she’s 
	deprecating her old DID and providing her new DID with authentic digital signatures. Again, for entirely offline 
	connections, this must be done one by one but it means that Samira is able to manage all of her secure communications
	across her devices, platforms, and applications in a consistent way, thanks to the security features provided by DIDs.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="messagingChallenges">
        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p>
Samira's use of a DID-based communication system comes with a number of
user experience challenges. These include the management of her different
communication contexts and switching between them, as well as the
automation of connection management with things like key rotation,
updating service endpoints, and routing via Agents. Users should not be
exposed to the details of such coordination, but should be able to
interact with, modify, and audit the process as needed. It’s likely that
users will be interacting with secure messaging protocols via a number
of different interfaces &amp; devices and for a variety of different
purposes, though the logic and experience should be coherent and
consistent across different platforms.

Many DID use cases describe the need for authenticated communication and
cryptographic security. This use case focuses on today's reliance on phone
numbers or email addresses as primary identifiers for messaging services,
and illustrates how DIDs can be the backbone of a resilient message-based
architecture for the internet which is asynchronous, not mediated by third
parties, and empowering of everyday use of cryptographic identifiers for
both basic messaging and higher-level communications.
